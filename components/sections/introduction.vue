          WHAT IS WEBSITE ACCESSIBILITY?
        </h2>
        <p class="intro-paragraph">
          Website accessibility refers to development and design best- practices that all users -- regardless of their disability -- need to perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with a website. The most widely accepted standards for website accessibility are the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0. These standards provide guidelines for developing websites that accommodate users who rely on assistive devices, adding a layer of usability and improving the experience for all users.
