# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

This app also uses `dotenv` files. Use the `.env.template` file for a list of required environment variables, then save them with their values in a `.env` file.
